## Node Express Handlebars

##  This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat

## Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured

## Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page

## The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not
